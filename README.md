# Huffman Compression

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the **Huffman Coding Algorithm**, a lossless data compression technique. Huffman coding assigns shorter binary codes to more frequent characters and longer codes to less frequent ones, optimizing the compression of the input text.

## How Huffman Coding Works

Huffman coding is a greedy algorithm that uses a binary tree to assign variable-length binary codes to each character in the input text. The most frequent characters are assigned shorter codes, while the less frequent ones are assigned longer codes, thus reducing the overall size of the compressed data.

### Steps:
1. **Frequency Calculation**: The frequency of each character in the text is calculated.
2. **Priority Queue Construction**: A priority queue (min-heap) is constructed, where each node represents a character and its frequency.
3. **Tree Building**: The two nodes with the smallest frequencies are repeatedly merged to form a binary tree.
4. **Code Generation**: The binary codes for each character are generated by traversing the tree. Left branches represent `0`, and right branches represent `1`.
5. **Compression**: The input text is converted to a binary sequence using the generated codes, and both the compressed data and the dictionary (for decompression) are saved to files.

## Features

- Compress text either by manual input or from a file.
- Outputs the compressed text to `compressed_text.txt`.
- Generates a dictionary of symbols and their corresponding Huffman codes in `dict.txt`.

## Functions

### `buildHuffmanTree(vector<Node*>& nodes)`
- **Purpose**: Builds the Huffman tree from a list of character nodes.
- **Process**: 
    - Uses a priority queue (min-heap) to combine nodes with the smallest frequencies.
    - Creates a binary tree, with each internal node representing the combined frequency of its child nodes.
    - Recursively generates binary codes by traversing the tree.

### `compressData(const string& data)`
- **Purpose**: Compresses the input text using Huffman coding.
- **Process**:
    - Computes character frequencies and builds the Huffman tree.
    - Generates Huffman codes for each character and applies them to compress the input text.
    - Saves the compressed text to `compressed_text.txt` and the dictionary to `dict.txt`.

### `main()`
- **Purpose**: Handles user input and calls the appropriate functions to compress data.
- **Process**:
    - Offers two options: manual text input or file input.
    - Based on the user's choice, it either reads the text from the console or loads it from a specified file, then compresses the text using the `compressData` function.


## Huffman Coding Overview

Huffman coding is a popular lossless data compression algorithm, used in many applications like ZIP files and JPEG image compression. The algorithm efficiently reduces the size of data by creating a variable-length prefix code based on character frequency.

The algorithm can be summarized as follows:
- Calculate the frequency of each character.
- Build a priority queue (min-heap) where each character is a leaf node.
- Extract two nodes with the smallest frequencies and combine them to create a new internal node with a frequency equal to the sum of the two nodes.
- Repeat this process until only one node remains â€” the root of the Huffman tree.
- Generate binary codes by traversing the tree. Left branches correspond to a `0`, and right branches to a `1`.

Huffman coding guarantees an optimal prefix code, ensuring that no code is a prefix of any other, thus enabling unambiguous decoding of the compressed data.

## Files Generated

- `compressed_text.txt`: Contains the compressed binary data.
- `dict.txt`: Contains the dictionary of characters and their corresponding Huffman codes.
